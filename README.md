## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript** for logic
- **Chrome Alarms API** for scheduling reminders
- **Chrome Notifications API** for push notifications
- **Chrome Storage API** for saving tasks
- **Custom CSS** for styling

## Known Issues
- If the notification sound does not play, ensure Chrome allows sound for notifications.
- Default Chrome notification sound may still play alongside the custom sound.

## Future Improvements
- Add an option to disable sound notifications
- Allow users to edit or delete tasks manually
- Provide a history log of completed tasks
