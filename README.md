- Receive push notifications when the task is due
- Play a custom sound with notifications
- Automatically remove completed tasks (optional setting)
- Simple and clean UI using custom styling
- **Settings Page** to customize preferences (e.g., keep task history)

## Usage
1. Click on the extension icon in Chromeâ€™s toolbar to open the popup.
2. Add a new task and set the reminder time.
3. When the time arrives, a notification with sound will appear.
4. The task will be automatically removed after notification (unless the setting to keep history is enabled).
5. Open the **Settings Page** to customize task history preferences.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript** for logic
- **Chrome Alarms API** for scheduling reminders
- **Chrome Notifications API** for push notifications
- **Chrome Storage API** for saving tasks and settings
- **Custom CSS** for styling

## Known Issues
- If the notification sound does not play, ensure Chrome allows sound for notifications.
- Default Chrome notification sound may still play alongside the custom sound.

## Future Improvements
- Add an option to customize notification sounds
- Allow users to set recurring tasks
- Provide more customization options in settings
